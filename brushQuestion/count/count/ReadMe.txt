David, a bookworm, enjoys every single word of a book. He is so special that he even knows how many times a specific word appears in a book. 



Sadly, there are always people who are jealous of other¡¯s talents. 


David's friend Young has always been suspicious about his talent but couldn¡¯t dare to manually check whether his answer is correct or not. He wants to ask for your help.

 

When story B is given, find how many times certain word S appears. Take note that a part where the certain word appears may be redundant. If B="ABABA" and S="ABA", ¡°ABA¡± is considered to be appeared twice.
